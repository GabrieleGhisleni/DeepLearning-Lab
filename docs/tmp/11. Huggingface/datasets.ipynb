    " It connects a model with its necessary preprocessing and postprocessing steps, allowing us to directly input any text and get an intelligible answer:\n",

    "- translation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Zero-shot classification\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll start by tackling a more challenging task where we need to classify texts that haven’t been labelled. This is a common scenario in real-world projects because annotating text is usually time-consuming and requires domain expertise. For this use case, the zero-shot-classification pipeline is very powerful: it allows you to specify which labels to use for the classification, so you don’t have to rely on the labels of the pretrained model. You’ve already seen how the model can classify a sentence as positive or negative using those two labels — but it can also classify the text using any other set of labels you like.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Named entity recognition\n",
    "Named entity recognition (NER) is a task where the model has to find which parts of the input text correspond to entities such as persons, locations, or organizations. Let’s look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "from transformers import pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "ner = pipeline(\"ner\", grouped_entities=True)\n",
    "ner(\"My name is Sylvain and I work at Hugging Face in Brooklyn.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question answering\n",
    "The question-answering pipeline answers questions using information from a given context:\n",

    "\n",
    "question_answerer = pipeline(\"question-answering\")\n",
    "question_answerer(\n",
    "    question=\"Where do I work?\",\n",
    "    context=\"My name is Sylvain and I work at Hugging Face in Brooklyn\",\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# {'score': 0.6385916471481323, 'start': 33, 'end': 45, 'answer': 'Hugging Face'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that this pipeline works by extracting information from the provided context; it does not generate the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "All the Transformer models mentioned above (GPT, BERT, BART, T5, etc.) have been trained as language models. This means they have been trained on large amounts of raw text in a self-supervised fashion. Self-supervised learning is a type of training in which the objective is automatically computed from the inputs of the model. That means that humans are not needed to label the data!\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of model develops a statistical understanding of the language it has been trained on, but it’s not very useful for specific practical tasks. Because of this, the general pretrained model then goes through a process called transfer learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "During this process, the model is fine-tuned in a supervised way — that is, using human-annotated labels — on a given task.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a task is predicting the next word in a sentence having read the n previous words. This is called **causal language modeling** because the output depends on the past and present inputs, but not the future ones. Another example is **masked language modeling**, in which the model predicts a masked word in the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformes are big models, apart from a few outliers (like DistilBERT), the general strategy to achieve better performance is by increasing the models’ sizes as well as the amount of data they are pretrained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transfer Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "the idea of transfer learning is to initialize the weights from an already trained model a fine tuning the last layer for our purposes. pretrained models are usually trained on very large amount of data and that is why they tend to work always better than models trained from scratch. \n",
    "\n",
    "usually, transfer learning is applied by dropping the head of the pretrained model while keeping its body. Fine-tuning, on the other hand, is the training done after a model has been pretrained. To perform fine-tuning, you first acquire a pretrained language model, then perform additional training with a dataset specific to your task.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architectures introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is primarily composed of two blocks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encoder: The encoder receives an input and builds a representation of it (its features). This means that the model is optimized to acquire understanding from the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these parts can be used independently, depending on the task:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encoder-only model**s: Good for tasks that require understanding of the input, such as sentence classification and named entity recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decoder-only models**: Good for generative tasks such as text generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encoder-decoder models or sequence-to-sequence models**: Good for generative tasks that require an input, such as translation or summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key feature of Transformer models is that they are built with special layers called attention layers. all you need to know is that this layer will **tell the model to pay specific attention to certain words** in the sentence you passed it (and more or less ignore the others) when dealing with the representation of each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same concept applies to any task associated with natural language: a word by itself has a meaning, but that meaning is deeply affected by the context, which can be any other word (or words) before or after the word being studied.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architectures vs. checkpoints\n",
    "As we dive into Transformer models in this course, you’ll see mentions of architectures and checkpoints as well as models. These terms all have slightly different meanings:\n",
    "\n",
    "Architecture: This is the skeleton of the model — the definition of each layer and each operation that happens within the model.\n",
    "Checkpoints: These are the weights that will be loaded in a given architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encoder\n",
    "\n",
    "The encoder outputs a numerical representation for each word used as input. the numerical representation is called **Feature vector**, it contains one vector per word (numerical representation), the dimension of the vector is defined by the architecture of the model itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each word in the initial sequence affects every word's representation, they are **contextual vectors**. it does this thanks to the self-attention mechanism. The representation of the word is given by the others words in the prase.\n",
    "\n",
    "encoders can use a standalone models and are particular good when we have to extract meaningful information, we are dealing with sequence classification, q&a and masked language modelling. \n",
    "\n",
    "if we are dealing with masked language modelling to usage of encoders, with their bi-directional context, are very good in term of accuracy. They are also good in text-classification as sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encoder models use only the encoder of a Transformer model. At each stage, the attention layers can access all the words in the initial sentence. These models are often characterized as having “bi-directional” attention, and are often called auto-encoding models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pretraining of these models usually revolves around somehow corrupting a given sentence (for instance, by masking random words in it) and tasking the model with finding or reconstructing the initial sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encoder models are best suited for tasks requiring an understanding of the full sentence, such as sentence classification, named entity recognition (and more generally word classification), and extractive question answering. (ALBERT, BERT, DistilBERT, ELECTRA, RoBERTa)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decoder \n",
    "The decoder uses the encoder’s representation (features) along with other inputs to generate a target sequence. This means that the model is optimized for generating outputs.Decoder models use only the decoder of a Transformer model. At each stage, for a given word the attention layers can only access the words positioned before it in the sentence. These models are often called auto-regressive models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pretraining of decoder models usually revolves around predicting the next word in the sentence. These models are best suited for tasks involving text generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encoder-Decoder\n",
    "\n",
    "Encoder generates numerical representation of the text, in this case we pass direct the numerical representation of the encoder to the decoder as well with a start of sequence word.\n",
    "\n",
    "the decoder decode the sequence a output a word. not as in an autoregressive model in combination with the representation of the encoder can used to generate a second word.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also the possibility to create an encoder-decoder assembling a custom encoder model and a decoder model\n",
    "\n",
    "# HuggingFace Models\n",
    "\n",
    "looking at the sentiment analysis we have three stages: the tokenizer, then this output is given to the model and finally we generate the probability from the log-odds.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tokenizer API\n",
    "\n",
    "Like other neural networks, Transformer models can’t process raw text directly, so the first step of our pipeline is to convert the text inputs into numbers that the model can make sense of. To do this we use a tokenizer, which will be responsible for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Splitting the input into words, subwords, or symbols (like punctuation) that are called tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mapping each token to an integer\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adding additional inputs that may be useful to the model\n",
    "\n",
    "All this preprocessing needs to be done in exactly the same way as when the model was pretrained, so we first need to download that information from the Model Hub. o do this, we use the AutoTokenizer class and its from_pretrained() method. Using the checkpoint name of our model, it will automatically fetch the data associated with the model’s tokenizer and cache it\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "from transformers import AutoTokenizer\n",
    "\n",
    "checkpoint = \"distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english\"\n",
    "tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(checkpoint)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have the tokenizer, we can directly pass our sentences to it and we’ll get back a dictionary that’s ready to feed to our model! The only thing left to do is to convert the list of input IDs to tensors (**Transformer models only accept tensors as input**).\n",

Another way is to **pad the sentences at the batch creation**, to the length of the longest sentence, this is called **dynamic padding**. using this approach all the batches will have the smallest lenght possible but the main cons is that there are some instruments like TPU tat does not wprk so well with that. \n",

    "The function that is responsible for putting together samples inside a batch is called a collate function. It’s an argument you can pass when you build a DataLoader, the default being a function that will just convert your samples to PyTorch tensors and concatenate them (recursively if your elements are lists, tuples, or dictionaries). This won’t be possible in our case since the inputs we have won’t all be of the same size. We have deliberately postponed the padding, to only apply it as necessary on each batch and avoid having over-long inputs with a lot of padding. To do this in practice, we have to define a collate function that will apply the correct amount of padding to the items of the dataset we want to batch together. Fortunately, the 🤗 Transformers library provides us with such a function via DataCollatorWithPadding. It takes a tokenizer when you instantiate it (to know which padding token to use, and whether the model expects padding to be on the left or on the right of the inputs) and will do everything you need:\n"

    "\n",
    "it translate text into numbers, there are several possible approach to do this having the goal to encode the text while keeping as meaning as possible. we have at least three options:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Word-based tokenizer\n",
    "The first type of tokenizer that comes to mind is word-based. It’s generally very easy to set up and use with only a few rules, and it often yields decent results. we basically split each sentence according to some criterion (spaces, punctuation).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also variations of word tokenizers that have extra rules for punctuation. With this kind of tokenizer, we can end up with some pretty large “vocabularies,” where a vocabulary is defined by the total number of independent tokens that we have in our corpus. Each word gets assigned an ID, starting from 0 and going up to the size of the vocabulary. The model uses these IDs to identify each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to completely cover a language with a word-based tokenizer, we’ll need to have an identifier for each word in the language, which will generate a huge amount of tokens. For example, there are over 500,000 words in the English language, so to build a map from each word to an input ID we’d need to keep track of that many IDs. Finally, we need a custom token to represent words that are not in our vocabulary. This is known as the “unknown” token, often represented as ”[UNK]” or ””. It’s generally a bad sign if you see that the tokenizer is producing a lot of these tokens, as it wasn’t able to retrieve a sensible representation of a word and you’re losing information along the way. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Character-based \n",
    "Character-based tokenizers split the text into characters, rather than words. This has two primary benefits: The vocabulary is much smaller.There are much fewer out-of-vocabulary (unknown) tokens, since every word can be built from characters. This approach isn’t perfect either. Since the representation is now based on characters rather than words, one could argue that, intuitively, it’s less meaningful: each character doesn’t mean a lot on its own, whereas that is the case with words. However, this again differs according to the language; in Chinese, for example, each character carries more information than a character in a Latin language.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Subword-based\n",
    "\n",
    "Subword tokenization algorithms rely on the principle that frequently used words should not be split into smaller subwords, but rare words should be decomposed into meaningful subwords. For instance, “annoyingly” might be considered a rare word and could be decomposed into “annoying” and “ly”. These are both likely to appear more frequently as standalone subwords, while at the same time the meaning of “annoyingly” is kept by the composite meaning of “annoying” and “ly”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example showing how a subword tokenization algorithm would tokenize the sequence “Let’s do tokenization!“:\n",
    "\n",
    "> let's</w> do</w> token ##ization</w> !</w>\n",
    "\n",
    "These subwords end up providing a lot of semantic meaning: for instance, in the example above “tokenization” was split into “token” and “ization”, two tokens that have a semantic meaning while being space-efficient (only two tokens are needed to represent a long word). This allows us to have relatively good coverage with small vocabularies, and close to no unknown tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "subword based is the more robust approach. the idea is to finding a middle ground between word and character-based algorithm. They rely on the principle that frequently used words should not be split into smaller subwords, but rare words should be decomposed into meaningful subwords.\n",
    "\n",

If you’ve ever worked with tensors before, you know that they need to be of rectangular shape, so you won’t be able to convert the list of input IDs into a tensor directly. To work around this problem, we usually pad the inputs.\n",
